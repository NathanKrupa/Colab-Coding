# Colab-Coding
This folders will house code that I've developed in Google Colab to meet various needs. 

I've learned to love the flexibility of using Google Colab to experiment with programs. It combines the flexibility of a Jupyter notebook with the protection of virtual machines. I don't have to run this code on my own machine, which protects any machine that I'm using to code.

So far, I have written the following programs:

1. A program to take full-size photos, resize them, and upload them via REST API to a WordPress site. 
2. A program to create custom QR codes using full color images.
3. A program to create custom QR codes.
4. A program to track the performance of a list of stocks.
5.
